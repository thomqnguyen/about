									<h3 class="major">Starting off</h3>
									<p></p>
									
									<p>I began birding in 2019, and the pandemic shifted it into high gear. My initial fascination was actually with birders, rather than birds (despite growing up loving wildlife). Some of my first bird outings in the Spring of 2019 were at Binghamton University's Nature Preserve. Before that point, I had not spent much time in natural spaces, as there was much less access to greenspace while growing up in New York City.</p>

									<p>I moved to Durham, NC for my PhD and started with some outing with the local Audubon chapter. The pandemic really shifted the interest into more of an obsession. I began birding more with other new birders and haven't looked back. Nowadays, I bird to explore and meditate in my surroundings.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Where I've been</h3>
									<p>Birding offers me an opportunity to explore many parts of my adopted state, North Carolina. Perhaps one day, I'll make it out to all 100 counties. With friends and family in New York and California, I hope to begin exploring those states like I have in NC.  </p>
